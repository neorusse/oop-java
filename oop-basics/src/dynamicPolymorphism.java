// Dynamic polymorphism is the mechanism by which methods can be defined with the same name,
// return type, and parameters in the base class and derived classes.
// The call to an overridden method is decided at the runtime.

// Letâ€™s consider the example of the Shape class:

// Shape Class
class Shape {

  public double getArea() {
    return 0;
  }

}

// A Rectangle is a Shape
class Rectangle extends Shape {  // extended form the Shape class

  private double length;
  private double width;

  public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  }

  public double getArea() {
    return this.width * this.length;
  }

}

// A Circle is a Shape
class Circle extends Shape {

  private double radius;

  public Circle(double radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  public double getArea() {
    return 3.13 * this.radius * this.radius;
  }


  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Shape[] shape = new Shape[2]; // Creating the shape array of size 2

    shape[0] = new Circle(3); // creating the circle object at index 0
    shape[1] = new Rectangle(2, 3); // creating the rectangle object at index 1

    System.out.println("Area of Circle: " + shape[0].getArea());
    System.out.println("Area of Rectangle: " + shape[1].getArea());
  }

}

// output

// Area of Circle: 28.17
// Area of Rectangle: 6.0

// REFERENCE VARIABLE

// A reference variable of the base class can be referred to the derived classes objects:

  Shape obj1 = new Circle(3);
  Shape obj2 = new Rectangle(2, 3);

  obj1.getName();
  obj2.getName();

  // Here, the reference variables obj1 and obj2 are of the Shape class, but they are pointing to the Circle and Rectangle respectively.

// Explanation

// obj1.getName() will execute getName() method of the subclass -> Circle class.
// obj2.getName() will execute getName() method of the subclass -> Rectangle class.
// obj1 is a reference to the Circle class, it calls the method of Circle class, as it points to a Circle object.
// obj2 is a reference to the Rectangle class, it calls the method of Rectangle class, as it points to a Rectangle object.

// This is decided during runtime and is, therefore, called dynamic or runtime polymorphism.
