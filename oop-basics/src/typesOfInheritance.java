// Based upon superclasses and subclasses, there are the following five types of inheritance in general:
//
//    Single
//    Multi-level
//    Hierarchical
//    Multiple
//    Hybrid

// 1. Single Inheritance

// In single inheritance, there is only a single class extending from another class.
// We can take the example of the Vehicle class (Super class) and the Car class (Sub class).
// Letâ€™s implement these classes below:

class Vehicle {          //Base Vehicle class

  private int topSpeed;
  public void setTopSpeed(int speed) {
    this.topSpeed=speed;
    System.out.println("The top speed is set to: "+ topSpeed);
  }

}

class Car extends Vehicle { // sub class Car extending from Vehicle

  public void openTrunk() {
    System.out.println("The Car trunk is Open Now");
  }

}

class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car corolla = new Car();
    corolla.setTopSpeed(220);
    corolla.openTrunk();
  }

}

// 2. Multi-level Inheritance

// When a class is derived from such a class which itself is derived from another class,
// this type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance. Classes can be extended to any
// further levels as per the requirement of the model.

// Example

// A Car IS A Vehicle
// A Prius IS A Car


class Vehicle {          //Base Vehicle class

  private int topSpeed;

  public void setTopSpeed(int speed) {
    this.topSpeed=speed;
    System.out.println("The top speed is set to: "+ topSpeed);
  }

}

class Car extends Vehicle { // Derived from Vehicle Base for Prius

  public void openTrunk() {
    System.out.println("The Car trunk is Open Now!");
  }

}

class Prius extends Car {// Derived from Prius & can be base to any further class

  public void turnOnHybrid() {
    System.out.println("The Hybrid mode is turned on!");
  }

}

class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Prius priusPrime = new Prius();
    priusPrime.setTopSpeed(220);
    priusPrime.openTrunk();
    priusPrime.turnOnHybrid();
  }

}

// 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

// When more than one classes inherit from the same class, it is referred to as hierarchical inheritance.
// In hierarchical inheritance, more than one classes extend, as per the requirement of the design,
// from the same base class. The common attributes of these child classes are implemented inside the base class.

// Example:

//  A Car IS A Vehicle
//  A Truck IS A Vehicle

class Vehicle {          //Base Vehicle class

  private int topSpeed;

  public void setTopSpeed(int speed) {
    this.topSpeed=speed;
    System.out.println("The top speed of "+getClass().getSimpleName()+" is set to: "+ topSpeed);
  }

}

class Car extends Vehicle { // Derived from Vehicle Base for Prius

  //implementation of Car class
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {// Derived from Prius can be base to any further class

  //implementation of Truck class
}

class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car corolla = new Car();
    corolla.setTopSpeed(220);

    Truck volvo = new Truck();
    volvo.setTopSpeed(120);
  }

}

// 4. Multiple Inheritance

// When a class is derived from more than one base class, i.e. when a class has more
// than one immediate parent classes, this type of inheritance is called Multiple Inheritance.

// Example

// A Hyundai Elantra IS A Car.
// A Hyundai Elantra IS A Sedan also.


// 5. Hybrid Inheritance

// A type of inheritance which is a combination of Multiple and Multi-level inheritance is called hybrid inheritance.

// A combustion engine is an engine
// An electric motors engine is an engine
// A Hybrid engine combines both combustion engine and electric motors.
